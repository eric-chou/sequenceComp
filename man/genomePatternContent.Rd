\usage{
comparePatternContent(seqList, pattern, baseOnly = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{seqList}{(required): BSgenome or a list of sequences, each for which the content is to be calculated. It is recommended that the elements of this data structure be named for readability of output. Otherwise, the output will provide the corresponding index occupied by the sequence in the original datas tructure that was provided alongside its calculated ratio.}

\item{pattern}{(required): String for a contiguous pattern of bases that are to be used for calculating their observed to expected ratios in each sequence provided.}

\item{baseOnly}{(default TRUE): boolean for if the user wants to calculate the content on using the base pair characters (ex. A, T, C, G for DNA) in the sequence, or from all characters in the sequence.}
}
\value{
Named vector of observed to expected ratios of pattern occurrences for each provided sequence.
}
\description{
Computes the ratio of observed to expected occurrences for a contiguous pattern of bases for each sequence in a genome or a list of sequences. These ratios are then outputted in either ascending or descending order of content.
