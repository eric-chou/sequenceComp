\usage{
getPatternContent(seq, pattern, baseOnly = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{seq}{(required): Biostring sequence, or a StringSet of multiple Biostring sequences for which the content is to be calculated.}

\item{pattern}{(required): String for a contiguous pattern of bases that are to be used for calculating their observed and expected occurrences in the sequence(s) provided.}

\item{baseOnly}{(default TRUE): boolean for if the user wants to calculate the content on using the base pair characters (ex. A, T, C, G for DNA; A, U, C, G for RNA) in the sequence, or from all characters in the sequence.}
}
\value{
Unlike getBaseContent, this provides not proportions or percentages for each sequence, but either a ratio of observed to expected counts.
}
\description{
Computes the observed content in a sequence for a given pattern of bases, as well as the expected content for that pattern.
}
